  {
    "topic": "febbox_token",
    "question": "My febbox token fails during setup, what should I do?",
    "answer": "If your Febbox token fails, first try setting up a custom DNS, as your Internet Service Provider may be blocking it. If that doesn't work, the issue may be with the Febbox/Fed-Api service itself. In that case, the only solution is to wait and try again later."
